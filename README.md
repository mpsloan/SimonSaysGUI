# SimonSaysGUI
This is the main method of a SimonSaysGUI which selects random sequences of the colors
red, blue, green, and yellow and highlights them to the user. Once the combination is 
done, the program pauses and allows the user to enter the sequence in the exact order. 
If the user's sequence is the exact same as the randomly generated one, the game moves
on to the next level and adds two more colors to the sequence each time.
